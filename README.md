### 📄 `README.md`

# [erez.ac](https://erez.ac)

**Personal portfolio website powered by Flask, Gunicorn, and SQLite**, containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

This README.md has been originally automatically generated by ChatGPT and has been curated by myself. ChatGPT 4o has been used to advise in parts of the project. Mostly, I ask for roadmap advice and templates and try to write most of the stuff myself because, first and foremost, I'm doing this project to learn new stuff. If I ever feel I don't know what I'd be putting up in my project, I try asking the LLM to explain it to me and / or confirm it by googling.

## 🚀 Features

- Flask web app with Jinja2 templates
- Styled terminal-style intro with cowsay integration
- SQLite database backend
- Lightweight, production-ready Docker setup using Gunicorn

## 🐳 Running Locally (with Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To rebuild without cache (e.g. after changing dependencies or database):

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

No external `.env` file required. Flask loads the pre-built SQLite database from:

```
/app/data/site.db
```

You'll need to initialise the database manually:

```bash
sqlite3 app/data/site.db < schema.sql
```

> Note: You can also generate the schema using SQLAlchemy if needed. For production, the database is prebuilt.

---

## 📦 Production Notes

- Gunicorn is used as the WSGI server inside the container
- The Flask app binds to `0.0.0.0:80`
- External services like Nginx and SSL termination (e.g. Let's Encrypt) are configured outside the scope of this repo
- Deployments pull this repo, rebuild using Docker Compose, and restart the container
