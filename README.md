## 🚀 Features

- Flask web app with Jinja2 templates
- Styled terminal-style intro with cowsay integration

## 🐳 Running Locally (with Docker)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To rebuild without cache (e.g. after changing dependencies or database):

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

No external `.env` file required. Flask loads the pre-built SQLite database from:

```
/app/data/site.db
```

You'll need to generate the database manually:

```bash
sqlite3 app/data/site.db < schema.sql
```

> Note: You can also generate the schema using SQLAlchemy if needed. For production, the database is prebuilt.

---

## 📦 Production Notes

- Gunicorn is used as the WSGI server inside the container
- The Flask app binds to `0.0.0.0:80`
- External services like Nginx and SSL termination (e.g. Let's Encrypt) are configured outside the scope of this repo
- Deployments pull this repo, rebuild using Docker Compose, and restart the container
